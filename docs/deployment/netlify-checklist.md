## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all files to Git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Netlify deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select your repository

3. **Verify Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `node build-netlify.js && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `public`
   - Base directory: (leave empty)

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   JWT_EXPIRATION=7d
   BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-site.netlify.app
   ```

5. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Monitor build logs for any issues

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

If you still encounter the "Base directory does not exist" error:

1. Ensure `netlify.toml` is in the repository root
2. Verify all files are committed and pushed
3. Check that base directory in `netlify.toml` is set to "."
4. Clear Netlify build cache and redeploy

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All files listed above are committed to Git
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster is set up and accessible
- [ ] Environment variables are prepared
- [ ] CORS origins are configured for your domain
- [ ] Build script runs successfully locally

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After following these steps:
- âœ… Build process should complete without "Base directory" errors
- âœ… Static files should be served from the `public` directory
- âœ… API endpoints should work via serverless functions
- âœ… Application should be fully functional on Netlify

**Note:** This configuration transforms your Node.js/Express application into a JAMstack application suitable for Netlify deployment using serverless functions.
